Building, designing, and maintaining your own website is a rewarding and creative hobby or practice.

* Everyone wonders how the web works. The best way to learn and explore curiosity is to build your own site!
* Unlike using centralized sites owned by businesses, you have complete control over your own website. Post what you want, how you want.
* You own your content, rather than giving it away, and you can organize it however you like. There's no danger that another service will lose your data or go away entirely.
* The web is vast, quirky, and surprising – you get to add to that!
